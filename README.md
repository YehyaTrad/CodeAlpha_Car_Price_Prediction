# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting car prices using **Linear Regression**, a supervised machine learning algorithm.  
The goal is to analyze how various car features influence pricing and to build a reliable prediction model.

This project was completed as **Task 3** of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the relationship between car features and prices
- Build and train a regression model
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Visualize actual vs predicted prices
- Save results for future reference and reporting

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Feature selection and target variable definition  
3. Train-test data split  
4. Model training using **Linear Regression**  
5. Model evaluation (MAE, MSE, R² Score)  
6. Visualization of predictions  
7. Saving output results

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**

These metrics help assess the accuracy and reliability of the prediction model.

---

## 🖼️ Output Visualization
The model generates a plot comparing **Actual vs Predicted Car Prices**, saved automatically inside the `results/` directory.
